A lightweight script used to display the contents of your CellarTracker cellar on your website.

== Description ==

This plugin grabs the contents of your CellarTracker wine cellar once a day and stores it on your server
allowing your users to see your wine cellar on your site, in your theme.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the winex directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Under "Manage" in the Administration area, update the WineX page with your CellarTracker Member #
5. At CellarTracker.com, once you are logged in, go to "My Account" then "Privacy Settings".  You will need
to set your "privacy level" to low in order for your webserver to get the cellar contents.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I get an "Access Denied" error? =
This means you need to set your "Privacy Settings" to Low at CellarTracker so your webserver can
view the contents of your cellar.

= Why do I see HTML code instead of my wine cellar? =
This means you need to set your "Privacy Settings" to Low at CellarTracker so your webserver can
view the contents of your cellar.
