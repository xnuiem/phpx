A plugin to show the contents of Subversion Repositories within your WP website.  Uses websvn as a base.        

== Description ==
SVNX allows you to setup a page for each Subversion repository, and display that page within your Wordpress website.  Security can be handled via Wordpress, as can CSS controls to customize the look and feel of the SVN files.  SVNX uses WebSVN as a backend.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the svnx directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Under the Tools menu, go to the 'SVNX' administration page 
4. Under "Configuration Options", set your path to your tmp directory and location of svn.  If you do not know, ask your server admin.
5. Under "Add Repository" fill in the form.  If you choose to create a page later, you will need to add a custom field called "svn" and set the value to the "ID" value on the SVNX default screen.
